# HR-Employee-Project

This is a data analysis project on HR data with a focus on the employee data.
Using MS SQL, I started off by conducting some minor data hygiene and preparing the data by changing data values and processing any null or duplicate data. Next, I queried to get the necessary information from the dataset and exported those tables to Power BI. In Power BI, I built a visually appealing dashboard which shows the employee statistics and information on the race, gender and location distribution across the company.
